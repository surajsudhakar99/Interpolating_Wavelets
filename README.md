# Interpolating Wavelets
This repository contains py files for reconstructing a surface by fitting the surface derivatives using interpolating wavelets. Follow the following instructions in order to use the programs.

## Setps to Follow:

1) Provide a file containing the points of a surface $f(x,y)$ in the following format
    
| x  | y | f(x,y) |
| ------------- | ------------- |------|
| -3.1415  | -3.1415  | 30.675 |
