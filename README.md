# Interpolating Wavelets
This repository contains py files for reconstructing a surface by fitting the surface derivatives using interpolating wavelets. Please note the following points before using the porgram.

## Note:

1) Provide a file containing the points of a surface $f(x,y)$ in the following format

$-0.31415900E+01\quad -0.31415900E+01\quad 0.14635719E+02$\
$-0.31415900E+01\quad -0.30781235E+01\quad  0.98100063E+01$\
$-0.31415900E+01\quad -0.30146571E+01\quad  0.92991668E+01$\
$-0.31415900E+01\quad -0.29511906E+01\quad  0.91413888E+01$\
$-0.31415900E+01\quad -0.28877241E+01\quad  0.90301097E+01$
    
2) Currently there are no provisions to change the paramters of the model through user interface but will be implemented soon.
