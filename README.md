# Interpolating Wavelets
This repository contains py files for reconstructing a surface by fitting the surface derivatives using interpolating wavelets. Follow the following instructions in order to use the programs.

## Setps to Follow:

1) Provide a file containing the points of a surface $f(x,y)$ in the following format

    $\underline{x}\quad\underline{y}\quad\underline{f(x,y)}$
